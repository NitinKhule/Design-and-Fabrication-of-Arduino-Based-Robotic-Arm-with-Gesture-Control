Designed and implemented a gesture-controlled robotic arm with Arduino, achieving 36 mm/s velocity and a 0.8 kg payload through optimized CAD modeling and precise system integration.

Programmed, calibrated, and validated control algorithms to ensure smooth and reliable robotic operation.

Integrated accelerometers, servo motors, and wireless modules for precise gesture-based control and seamless system performance.

Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to design, fabricate, and test a high-precision robotic arm.

Documented the development process and validated system performance through rigorous testing and calibration.
